    <p id="first"> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
        around to commiserate. They said, <q class = "villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
            unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class = "farmer">Maybe.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
        and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now
            have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q> <em class="farmer">Maybe.</em></q>
    </p>
    <p>
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
        leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <strong class=" bad">bad</strong>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmers">Maybe.</q> The next day the
        conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he
        had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class = "villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
        tell whether anything that happens in it is <strong class="good">good</strong> or <strong class="bad">bad</strong> — because you never know what will be the
        consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <strong class="good">good</strong> fortune.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p><strong>Good</strong> and <strong>Bad</strong> are just one perspective. Bananas are
            <strong>good</strong> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <strong> good</strong> for
            bananas.
            Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
