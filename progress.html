    <p> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
        around to commiserate. They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
            unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q>Maybe.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
        and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now
            have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q> <em>Maybe.</em></q>
    </p>
    <p>
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
        leg. The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too <strong class=" bad">bad</strong>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q>Maybe.</q> The next day the
        conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he
        had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q >Maybe.</q>
    </p>
